The goal of this project is to make an pure Python cross-platform mouse control module.

All over the internet there are scattered pieces of information and people screaming for help. I want to make mouse movement as simple as pymouse.move(x, y) and click as simple as pymouse.click(x, y, button)

**Status:** This project has moved to Github.com
