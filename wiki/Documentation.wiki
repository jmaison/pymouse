Since this is a very simple module, here is the very simple documentation.

= Introduction =

To use this plugin put the python files somewhere on the python path.
The next example illustrates basic usage:

{{{
# import the module
from pymouse import PyMouse

# instantiate an mouse object
m = PyMouse()

# move the mouse to int x and int y (these are absolute positions)
m.move(200, 200)

# click works about the same, except for int button possible values are 0: left, 1: middle, 2: right
m.click(500, 300, 1)

# get the screen size
m.screen_size()
# (1024, 768)

# get the mouse position
m.position()
# (500, 300)
}}}
